  **we can comparing one value in the script to what you expect like this
the result will be aboolean : true or false.**
**is equal to == compare two value if they are same.**
**is not equal to != compare two value if they are not same.**
**strict equal to === to check that both the data type and value are the same.**
**strict not equal to !== to check that both the data type and value are note the same.**
*logical operator to compare the results of more than one comparison operator - && and - || or - ! not
