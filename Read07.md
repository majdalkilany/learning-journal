**how javascript  makes our web page more interactive**

**javascript allows to make web pages more interactive by accissing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser**

- **react to events** : You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.
### Expressions 
* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
* statement is like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
* you might specify that a value must be remembered
* before creating a calculation using that value.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
* information used in the script.
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more
* than one piece of related information.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
* strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value


### Functions

**Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).**
